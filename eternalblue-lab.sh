echo ### ðŸ§  **EternalBlue Lab â€“ TryHackMe (Brief Description)**

echo The **EternalBlue** lab on **TryHackMe** is designed to teach users how to exploit the **SMB vulnerability (MS17-010)** used by the echo **EternalBlue exploit**, which was developed by the NSA and leaked by the Shadow Brokers. This vulnerability affects older versions of echo **Windows** and was infamously used in the **WannaCry ransomware attack**.

echo ### ðŸ§© Key Learning Objectives:

echo * Understand **SMB (Server Message Block)** protocol and its weaknesses.
echo * Identify vulnerable machines using tools like **Nmap**.
echo * Exploit the MS17-010 vulnerability using tools like **Metasploit** or manual scripts (e.g., `eternalblue_exploit7.py`).
echo * Gain remote **code execution** or a **reverse shell** on a Windows machine.
echo * Learn **post-exploitation** techniques such as privilege escalation.

echo ### ðŸ›  Tools Commonly Used:

echo * `nmap`
echo * `smbclient`
echo * `msfconsole` (Metasploit)
echo * `exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue`
echo * `mimikatz` (for credential dumping)
echo Let me know if you want the **full step-by-step walkthrough** of the lab!
